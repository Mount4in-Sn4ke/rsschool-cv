My main goal is to become a great Front-End developer and continue to develop as an excellent specialist. 
I started at RS School because I decided to do what I want, not my family. 
Therefore, I pulled myself together and decided to start learning programming.

I graduated from the bachelor's and master's programs at the Omsk State Technical University
in the direction of "Oil and Gas Business". 
I also have a diploma in the specialty "Translator in the field of professional communications"

My English level is almost ะก1 but I keep improving my skills with different mobile apps like "Duolingo" and "Simpler".
